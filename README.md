# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### Aveenash

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
-  Specifically, I realized that negative count values should be rounded down to zero. Additionally, I understood that the numbers within the count column should be rounded to zero. These changes were necessary to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the submitted results.
### What was the top ranked model that performed?
WeightedEnsemble_L3

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
- During the exploratory analysis, it was discovered that the demand varied throughout the day on weekdays and weekends. This insight led to incorporating time series analysis to capture the changes in demand within each hour. urthermore, continuous features such as temperature, humidity, and wind were categorized, likely to enhance the model's performance.

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
The model's performance saw a significant enhancement of around 20% after incorporating the additional features. The improvement can be attributed to the inclusion of relevant features based on domain knowledge. By considering factors such as the time of day and weather conditions, the model can make more accurate predictions.

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
A slight improvement in the kaggle score has been found after changing the hyper parameters.

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?


### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|default|default|default|1.38713|
|add_features|default|default|default|0.58444|
|hpo|CAT(iterations),RF(n_estimators), XT(n_estimators)|GB(num_boost_round, num_leaves)|scheduler, searcher|0.56331|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

## Summary
In this project, we have obtained/explored following steps in the ML Lifecycle.

- Problem:
    Better utilization of the data generated by the systems in the bike sharing industry as well as exogenous information are keys to take business advantages for firms.
    
- Business Objective:
    Predict bike sharing demand provided data related to different factors provided.

- Obtain Data
    Data is obtained from the "Bike Sharing Demand" kaggle competition.
   
- Analyze Data
    Data is described, visualized and modified mainly using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seabon library.
   
- Build Model
    Built models using Autogluon AutomML library. Initially created model without any preprocessing. Later, built models creating new features and tuning hyper parameters.
    
- Test Model
    Models are tested by submitting the predictions to Kaggle and compared the models based on the scroe obtained.
